# meteor-boilerplate
This project aims to be a boilerplate or scaffholding for meteor projects. The master branch has "vanilla" styling (no front-end framework). The materialize branch will use materializecss and the bootstrap branch will use bootstrap. There may be a semantic ui branch in the future (or feel free to add one).
